I have been exposed to technology since I was seven years old, thanks to my father,
who worked at a telecommunications company. Once, I visited him at work, and after this
first experience, I knew what I wanted to do in the future. Twelve years later, I embarked
on an Electronics Engineering degree, achieving a Cisco Certified Network Associate
qualification two years post-graduation. With these two credentials, I could build a
successful professional career in networking communications.

I earned my B.S. in Electronics Engineering from “Universidad Mayor de San Andres”
in La Paz, Bolivia. During my third undergraduate year, I received the "Guido Capra Gemio" award for academic excellence,
given to the best student in the Department. Throughout my education and career, I
pride myself on being among the top students and employees.

I possess extensive professional experience in information technology, specializing in
networking, operating systems, security, and programming. 

For over eleven years, I worked in the banking industry as a network administrator and later as an IT
department’s head, enhancing my teamwork, leadership, and time management skills. I
possess a personality committed to learning and mastering designs, processes, and programs.

In 2013, I moved to the US and as a volunteer I designed, implemented, and maintained a network project 
involving 88 virtual computers at a Denver Public School District school. Following its completion, I volunteered as an IT
support for the same school.  Recently, I was a consultant with the Colorado Geological Survey & Colorado School of Mines,
working on a project involving sensors, communications, databases, and programming.
Despite lacking a programming major, I independently learned Javascript, D3, and
Python and became proficient in those languages.

After living in Canada for two years, now I live in Las Cruces - New Mexico. Now I am enrolled in a Master's in Information Technology at New Mexico State University.
